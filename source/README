# Build the wrapper libraries. Note that the Makefile may require editing to set

# Build all the executables and install the scenarios.

# Install the scripts. Note that the installed version of Driver.py may require

## Instructions for creating a build to test code coverage. Note that this will
## require the installation of lcov or gcovr, either of which can be used to
## generated summarized results. The following commands should be executed from
## this directory (source).

# Run this file as a script. This will clean everything and do a full rebuild.

#	sh -x README

# 	export JASL_COMPILER_FLAGS="-O0 --coverage"

# Change the OBJ_SUB_DIRECTORY setting in ../util/jasl.make from ".obj" to ".".

# Build the jasl libraries again as follows. This, along with the change to
# OBJ_SUB_DIRECTORY, is necessary for the .gcno and .gcda files to be generated
# and work correctly.

#	(cd jasl/utilities;make clean_libs;make dynamic_lib)
#	(cd jasl/counters;make clean_libs;make dynamic_lib)
#	(cd jasl/ui/data;make clean_libs;make dynamic_lib)

# 	make build_cpp_dynamic

# 	make test_cpp_dynamic

# The following command uses gcovr to create an HTML summary of the coverage
# statistics in /tmp. Adjust accordingly if using lcov.

#	gcovr -r . --html --html-details -o /tmp/jasl_coverage.html

# Cleanup. Restore the original setting for OBJ_SUB_DIRECTORY and run the
# following commands.

#	find . -type f -name "*.gcda" -exec rm {} \;
#	find . -type f -name "*.gcno" -exec rm {} \;
#	find . -type f -name "*.o" -exec rm {} \;
#	unset JASL_COMPILER_FLAGS

# Rebuild everything for "normal" development / operation.

#	sh -x README
