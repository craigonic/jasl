<H2>Building the libraries defined in the sub-directories</H2>
The purpose of each target defined in the <A HREF=Makefile.html>Makefile</A> for
this directory is listed below. The files are written to or removed from their
respective output directories as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Object (.o) files - <B>&lt sub-directory name &gt/.obj</B>
<LI>Header (.h) files -
<B><I><A HREF="../../source.html#JASL_BASE">$JASL_BASE</A></I>/include/jasl/cni/&lt sub-directory name &gt</B>
<LI>Library files and links - <B><I>$JASL_BASE</I>/lib/jasl</B>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><TT>obj</TT> - compiles all of the source files in each sub-directory using
<TT><A HREF=http://gcc.gnu.org>gcc</A></TT>, placing the object (.o) files in
the corresponding directory noted above.
<LI><TT>hdr</TT> - copies the header files in each sub-directory to the
corresponding directory noted above.
<LI><I>none</I> or <TT>libs</TT> - executes the actions defined for the
<TT>obj</TT> target and then uses the object (.o) files to generate shared and
static libraries, as well as the necessary links, in the directory noted above. Upon completion, the <TT>clean</TT> target is used to remove the directories
containing the object (.o) files.
<P>
<LI><TT>clean</TT> - removes each of the directories noted above that are used
to store the object (.o) files.
<LI><TT>clean_hdr</TT> - removes each of the directories noted above that
contain copies of the header (.h) files.
<LI><TT>clean_libs</TT> - deletes the shared and static library files, as well
as the associated links, in the directory noted above.
<P>
<LI><TT>docs</TT> - generates an HTML version of the <U>Makefile</U> using
<TT><A HREF=http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html#Top>source-highlight</A></TT>,
placing it in
<B><I>$JASL_BASE</I>/share/jasl/doc/source/cni-wrapper/<A HREF=index.html>jasl</A></B>.
This file, <B>jasl.html</B>, is also generated, and includes links to all
of the HTML files generated by the same target, called from this one, in each
sub-directory.
